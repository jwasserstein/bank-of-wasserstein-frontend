- Refactor LandingPage.js to fix height responsiveness.  main-container has hard-coded height: 700px.
- Pull state out of Navbar.js, make each page stateful and pass everything down as props
- Prepend all class names with the component they belong to
- Add prominent display of account balance to TransactionPage
- Set autofocus to the first textbox for all forms
- Check that NewTransactionPage is centered
- When transaction list exceeds <main> elements, the background turns white.  Make the whole body green and just make the later slides of the landing page white
