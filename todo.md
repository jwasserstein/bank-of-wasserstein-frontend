- Organize container and component folders
- Add pictures to placeholders on landing page
- Fix coins-growing image squishing
- Make everything smaller
- Add accounts page
- Add delete account button to profile page
- Add proptypes
- Clarify that existing transfer is from one account to another.  Add option to transfer to one of my other accounts
- Make list of items a component (list of accounts, list of transactions, etc)
- Make button and display a component (new account, account balances.  new transaction, transaction balances)
- Verify that the componentDidMount() check for this.props.lastUpdated in TransactionPage is actually working.  It's not in the mapStateToProps() so I wonder if it's just sending a new request each time.
- Consider moving the tokens into the actions themselves (or even the apiCall).  No point in getting it everytime.
